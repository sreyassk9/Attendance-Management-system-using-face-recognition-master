# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

In this project, a computer system will be able to find and recognize human faces that are being captured through a camera. It is a smart attendance marking system using real-time face recognition.

The Face is detected and segmented from the video frame by using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradient) algorithm. It helps in conversion of the frames of the video into images so that the face of the student can be easily recognized and trained, then checks their face for their attendance so that it can be reflected automatically on the attendance database.
